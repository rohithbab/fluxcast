# FluxCast Physics Implementation Guide

## 🧮 How Gauss's Divergence Theorem Works in FluxCast

### The Mathematical Foundation:
```
∮∮ F·n dS = ∭ ∇·F dV
```

**Left Side (Surface Integral)**: Measures net flow through the boundary
**Right Side (Volume Integral)**: Measures sources/sinks inside the volume

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

#### 1. **User Input** 🎯
- You select a geographic region using sliders:
  - North/South latitude bounds
  - East/West longitude bounds  
  - Altitude range (0-1000m default)

#### 2. **Data Collection** 📡
```python
# FluxCast fetches wind data from OpenWeatherMap API
for each grid_point in selected_region:
    weather_data = get_weather(lat, lon)
    u_component = wind_speed * cos(wind_direction)  # East-West
    v_component = wind_speed * sin(wind_direction)  # North-South
    w_component = estimate_vertical_velocity(pressure)  # Up-Down
```

#### 3. **Divergence Calculation** 🔢
```python
# Calculate partial derivatives at each grid point
du_dx = gradient(u_component, longitude_spacing)
dv_dy = gradient(v_component, latitude_spacing)  
dw_dz = gradient(w_component, altitude_spacing)

# Divergence field
divergence = du_dx + dv_dy + dw_dz
```

#### 4. **Surface Integral** 📐
```python
# Net flux through all 6 faces of the volume
net_flux = (
    sum(u_east_face) - sum(u_west_face) +     # East-West faces
    sum(v_north_face) - sum(v_south_face) +   # North-South faces  
    sum(w_top_face) - sum(w_bottom_face)      # Top-Bottom faces
) * area_scaling_factor
```

#### 5. **Physical Interpretation** 🌬️
- **Positive Flux (+)**: Air expanding → Low pressure forming → Storms possible
- **Negative Flux (-)**: Air converging → High pressure forming → Clear weather
- **Near Zero**: Balanced conditions → Stable weather

## 🌪️ How Stokes' Circulation Theorem Works in FluxCast

### The Mathematical Foundation:
```
∮ F·dr = ∬ (∇ × F)·n dS
```

**Left Side (Line Integral)**: Circulation around the boundary
**Right Side (Surface Integral)**: Total rotation inside the area

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

#### 1. **User Input** 🎯
- You draw a closed path by tapping the map
- Or use quick options (Circular, Square)
- Path must have at least 3 points

#### 2. **Data Collection** 📡
```python
# Get wind data around and inside the path
bounding_box = find_bounds(path_points)
for each grid_point in bounding_box:
    weather_data = get_weather(lat, lon)
    u_component = wind_speed * cos(wind_direction)
    v_component = wind_speed * sin(wind_direction)
```

#### 3. **Curl Calculation** 🌀
```python
# Calculate curl (rotation) at each point
dv_dx = gradient(v_component, longitude_spacing)
du_dy = gradient(u_component, latitude_spacing)

# Curl z-component (vertical rotation)
curl_z = dv_dx - du_dy
```

#### 4. **Line Integral (Circulation)** 🔄
```python
circulation = 0
for i in range(len(path_points)-1):
    # Get wind vector at current point
    u_wind, v_wind = interpolate_wind(path_points[i])
    
    # Path segment vector
    dx = path_points[i+1].lon - path_points[i].lon
    dy = path_points[i+1].lat - path_points[i].lat
    
    # Add dot product F·dr
    circulation += u_wind * dx + v_wind * dy
```

#### 5. **Storm Detection** ⚠️
```python
# Storm risk criteria
high_circulation = abs(circulation) > 1000  # m²/s
high_curl = max(abs(curl_z)) > 0.015       # s⁻¹
storm_risk = high_circulation and high_curl
```

## 🎯 Real-World Example: Hurricane Analysis

### Gauss Analysis of a Hurricane:
```
Selected Region: 100km x 100km x 10km volume
Net Flux: -15,000 m³/s (Strong inflow)
Interpretation: Massive air convergence → Intense low pressure
Result: Hurricane eye detected!
```

### Stokes Analysis of the Same Hurricane:
```
Path: Circular, 50km radius around eye
Circulation: +25,000 m²/s (Counterclockwise)
Curl Magnitude: 0.08 s⁻¹ (Very high rotation)
Result: Extreme storm risk - Category 4+ hurricane
```

## 🔬 The Science Behind the Math

### Why Gauss Theorem Works for Weather:
1. **Conservation of Mass**: Air can't be created or destroyed
2. **Pressure Gradients**: Air flows from high to low pressure
3. **3D Atmosphere**: Weather happens in three dimensions
4. **Divergence = Pressure Change**: Math directly relates to physics

### Why Stokes Theorem Works for Weather:
1. **Coriolis Effect**: Earth's rotation creates circulation
2. **Vorticity**: Spinning air creates storms
3. **Circulation Conservation**: Rotation tends to persist
4. **Curl = Rotation**: Math measures the spin directly
